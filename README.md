# React Router v6 Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: unexpected navigation behavior.  The `Home` component contains a button intended to navigate to the `/about` route, but this navigation does not function correctly.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`. 

## Problem Description

The application uses React Router v6. Clicking the button in the `Home` component does not redirect to the `/about` route, causing unexpected behavior.
